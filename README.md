Deep Learning Model for Alphabet Soup: Charity Success Prediction

Overview

In this project, we develop a deep learning model to predict whether an Alphabet Soup-funded charity will be successful based on various features in the dataset. The process involves preprocessing the data, designing a neural network, training and evaluating the model, and optimizing its performance to reach a predictive accuracy above 75%. The final model is exported and stored for further analysis.

Methodology

Step 1: Preprocess the Data
We begin by reading the dataset (charity_data.csv) from a cloud URL into a Pandas DataFrame. The steps for preprocessing are as follows:

Identify Target and Feature Variables:
The target variable for the model is the column that indicates whether the charity was successful or not.
The features are the remaining columns that provide information about each charity's characteristics.
Drop Unnecessary Columns:
The EIN and NAME columns are dropped, as they are not relevant for prediction.
Unique Value Analysis:
We determine the number of unique values in each column.
For columns with more than 10 unique values, we determine the count of data points for each unique value.
Rare categories are grouped together under a new value, "Other," to reduce the complexity of categorical variables.
One-Hot Encoding:
Using pd.get_dummies(), categorical variables are encoded into binary format, making them suitable for use in the model.
Feature-Target Split:
The dataset is split into features (X) and target (y).
Train-Test Split:
The data is split into training and testing sets using train_test_split().
Scaling:
The features are scaled using scikit-learn's StandardScaler(), fitting it on the training data and transforming both the training and testing datasets.
Step 2: Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model
We build a neural network model using TensorFlow and Keras for binary classification:

Model Design:
The number of input features is used to determine the structure of the model.
The first hidden layer is created with an appropriate activation function.
If necessary, a second hidden layer is added.
The output layer uses a sigmoid activation function to predict binary outcomes.
Compilation and Training:
The model is compiled using an appropriate optimizer and loss function.
The model is trained on the preprocessed training data.
A callback is created to save the model's weights every five epochs.
Model Evaluation:
After training, the model is evaluated using the test data to determine its loss and accuracy.
The final model is saved and exported to an HDF5 file (AlphabetSoupCharity.h5).
Step 3: Optimize the Model
To optimize the model and achieve an accuracy higher than 75%, several strategies are employed:

Data Adjustments:
Modify the features and address any outliers or variables that may be confusing the model.
Experiment with different strategies for grouping rare categorical values.
Model Tweaks:
Add more neurons to hidden layers.
Experiment with additional hidden layers.
Adjust the number of epochs to improve model convergence.
Test different activation functions for the hidden layers.
After attempting several optimizations, the final model is trained and evaluated. The results are saved in a new HDF5 file (AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization.h5).

Step 4: Write a Report on the Neural Network Model
A detailed report is created to summarize the findings:

Overview of the Analysis: The goal was to build and optimize a deep learning model to predict charity success based on various input features.
Results:
Data Preprocessing:
The target variable is identified, and features are properly encoded.
Unnecessary columns are removed, and categorical variables are transformed.
Model Design:
The neural network model consists of an input layer, two hidden layers, and an output layer with a sigmoid activation.
Model Performance:
The model achieves a loss and accuracy that meets or exceeds the target threshold.
Optimization steps successfully improve performance.
Summary: The final model is evaluated, and recommendations are made for using other models like decision trees or gradient boosting to improve classification accuracy.
Step 5: Copy Files into Your Repository
After completing the analysis and finalizing the models, the following steps are performed:

The Colab notebooks are downloaded to the local machine.
The notebooks are moved into the "Deep Learning Challenge" directory of the local repository.
The files are pushed to GitHub for final submission.
Results

The neural network model trained on the preprocessed dataset showed significant improvement after optimization attempts.
The final model achieved a predictive accuracy above 75%, with a loss function minimized to an acceptable range.
The model's performance is exported and saved for future use.
